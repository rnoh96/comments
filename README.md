## Project Description ##
This web application showcases my understanding of various web development technologies such as jQuery DataTables, Ajax, PHP, and databases. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a commenting system that retrieves and displays comments stored in a database.

## What I have learned ##
- Implementing a dynamic and interactive commenting system using jQuery DataTables
- Making asynchronous requests to a server using Ajax
- Interacting with a database using PHP
- Storing and retrieving data in a database

I hope this project provides a glimpse of my understanding and capabilities in web development.
