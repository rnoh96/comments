# comments #
## Project Description ##
This web application showcases my understanding of various web development technologies such as jQuery DataTables, Ajax, PHP, and databases. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate a commenting system that retrieves and displays comments stored in a database.

## What I have learned ##
- Implementing a dynamic and interactive commenting system using jQuery DataTables
- Making asynchronous requests to a server using Ajax
- Interacting with a database using PHP
- Storing and retrieving data in a database

## What can be added in the future ##
- In the future, it may be beneficial to add a "username" column to the comments table. This would allow users to see who left each comment, which could be particularly useful in situations where multiple users may be leaving comments on a particular item or page.

- In addition to adding a "username" column, other potential improvements to the comments feature could include allowing users to reply to comments, adding the ability to edit or delete comments, or implementing a notification system to alert users when a new comment is left. These enhancements would require additional development work, but could help make the comments feature more interactive and user-friendly.



I hope this project provides a glimpse of my understanding and capabilities in web development.
